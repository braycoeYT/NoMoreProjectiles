Are you tired of [c/FF0000:projectile based bosses] just killing you unfairly?
Do you want a [c/00FF00:fair] true melee playthrough?
Do you want to [c/0000FF:prank] your friends?
Are you [c/FFFF00:bored] to death?
If any of these qualities describe you, No More Projectiles is the mod for you! It deletes all projectiles before they finish setting up! Now you'll have to think of new strats and ideas to survive this challenge!
(This is probably the stupidest mod ever)

Shameless self-advertising: I also own this content mod called Azercadmium, you can play it if you want or something.
